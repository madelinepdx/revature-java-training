# Revature Java Training

This repository contains all labs, challenges, and mini-projects completed during my full-stack Java training with Revature.

The projects are organized by week, and each folder reflects hands-on exercises focused on building core Java skills and backend development fundamentals.

## ðŸ“š Curriculum Overview

I am currently in **Week 8** of the program. This README will be updated each week as I complete new content.

- **Week 1**: Java basics â€” variables, control flow, object-oriented concepts
- **Week 2**: Arrays, methods, loops, and class design
- **Week 3**: Inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes
- **Week 4**: Exception handling, custom exceptions, file I/O
- **Week 5**: JDBC, SQL basics, working with databases in Java
- **Week 6**: REST APIs with Javalin, HTTP concepts, logging & testing
- **Week 7**: Collections framework, iterators, stacks, queues, and sorting algorithms  
- **Week 8**: Multithreading, synchronization, and advanced SQL concepts (TCL, DCL, stored procedures)  
- **Week 9**: Introduction to Spring, dependency injection, and Spring MVC annotations  
- **Week 10**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, REST testing, and actuator endpoints  
- **Week 11**: Final coding challenges, assessments, and capstone project submission

Each week includes:
- **Labs** â€” focused exercises for practice
- **Challenges** â€” problem-solving tasks or small coding tests
- **Mini-projects** â€” larger hands-on builds for skill integration

## Current Assigned Project: Social Media Blog API

This capstone REST API enables user registration, login, message creation, editing, deletion, and filtering by account.

### User Stories Implemented:
- âœ… Register new accounts (`POST /register`)
- âœ… User login (`POST /login`)
- âœ… Create new message (`POST /messages`)
- âœ… Get all messages (`GET /messages`)
- âœ… Get message by ID (`GET /messages/{message_id}`)
- âœ… Delete message by ID (`DELETE /messages/{message_id}`)
- âœ… Update message by ID (`PATCH /messages/{message_id}`)
- âœ… Get messages by user ID (`GET /accounts/{account_id}/messages`)

The project is tested with a graphical test runner and submitted through Revatureâ€™s platform for review and approval.
